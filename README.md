# GPO Audit
 
In this repository I'm going to document the process of a GPO Audit I'm conducting, including:
- [Understanding The GPO Structure](/Docs/Understanding%20The%20GPO%20Structure.md), Detailed explanation of the Group Policy Object structure (what is it, how it can be applied, etc)
- [Important Settings](/Docs/Important%20Settings.md), Collection of settings that should be taken into consideration when conducting a GPO audit
